    <p>Welcome to the Fantastic Four's version of nanoTwitter!</p>
    <br>

    <h3>What is nanoTwitter?</h3>
      <p>nanoTwitter is a lot like Twitter, only smaller. For those that don't know, Twitter is a social networking site that keeps you up to
        date with all the posts (Tweets) of the users that you're interested in. You can even make Tweets yourself.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>How do I access nanoTwitter for the first time?</h3>
      <p>Anyone can use nanoTwitter. To get started with it, you just follow these easy steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to the following site: <a href="http://nanotwitter-client.s3-website.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/"></a></li>
        <li>On the main page, click on the "login" button.</li>
        <li>On the login page, click on the "register here" link.</li>
        <li>On the registration page, provide a username and password that you'll remember, then hit the "register" button.</li>
        <li>You will be redirected to the main page and will need to log in again. Hit the "login" button again, fill in the user and password fields with your username and password, and click the "login" button again.</li>
